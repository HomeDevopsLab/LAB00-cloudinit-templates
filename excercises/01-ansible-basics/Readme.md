## About Ansible

Ansible is a great IaC tool designed to automate software installation and configuration tasks across many target systems.

One of the main advantages of Ansible is the low requirements for managed systems. There is no need to install Ansible on them. It is sufficient to have Python installed and a user account created that can be accessed via SSH.
